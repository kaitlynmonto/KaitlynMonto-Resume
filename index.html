        <div class="subheading mb-5">Biology Major</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I was born and raised in Riverside, California and am currently twenty years old. I attended and graduated from Polytechnic High School in Riverside. In high school, my hobbies included choir and community service. I was a part of choir for 6 years and I was involved in a club that went to convalescent homes to interact with patients. I am currently a third year college student at the University of California, Riverside. I am majoring in biology in hopes of pursuing a career in optometry. Science has always been intriguing to me and turned into something that I am extremely passionate about. After I graduate at UCR, I plan on attending one of the optometry schools in California.<br><br>

        My strengths include organization, teamwork, multitasking, and precisely follow instructions that are given. I am detail oriented and focused on maintaining organization and maximum efficiency during my tasks. <br><br>
        
        On campus, I am currently involved in a pre-optometry club to enhance my knowledge of the field. In the club, we are able to get hands on experience, learn about different optometry colleges, and tips ot be successful in the field. I am also involved in a community service club, called SHARP, that focuses on helping the homeless community in Riverside. In SHARP, I am a director of inventory on their board so I provide the supplies for the meetings to create peanut butter and jelly sandwiches as well as hygiene kits. After our club meetings, fellow members and myself donate the items to a locol homeless shelter. Contributing to and bettering the community has become a great passion of mine.  <br><br>
        
        My first occupation was as a temporary call center receptionist during the covid-19 pandemic. I answered phone calls to help patients schedule appointments for covid vaccinations. It was a fast-paced environment that required maximum efficiency. I improved with customer interactions, strengthened my multitasking skills, and I was introduced to filing and organizing patient information.<br><br> 
        
        Outside of college, my occupation is at an optometrist office inside of a Costco store. My position is currently as a receptionist and technician. Half of my day is spent as a receptionist and then I switch to take on the technician role. As a receptionist, there is plent of multitasking involved, such as answering phones, scheduling patients, checking patients in and out, and filing. For the technician portion, I am able to pre-test patients before they go in to see the optometrist. There is plenty of patient interaction and hands on experience in the office, which is beneficial for the career that I am pursuing. I am able to learn about the business aspect of the field, pre-test patients, and gain more knowledge in the optometry field.
